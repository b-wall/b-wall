## About Me

Based in Asia for the past 6 years teaching English, I discovered programming during the pandemic and became infatuated with it. I have been learning it ever since.

I started with Harvard University's CS50X "Introduction to Computer Science", and moved on to the Django web-framework to make a bunch of fully-fleshed out web apps. 

I'm currently employed as a developer in the Shopify e-commerce space, working with tools such as Remix, Rust and Liquid.

- **ðŸŒ± Currently Learning:** Rust, Remix, VIM!

If you are somebody with a like-minded mindset, please don't hesitate to contact me.
