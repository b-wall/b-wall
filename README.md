## About Me

Based in Asia for the past 6 years teaching English, I discovered programming during the pandemic and became infatuated with it. I have been learning in the morning and working in the evening ever since!

I enjoy the problem solving and discovery that goes with software development, as well as creating something from nothing! I can't wait to learn more!
